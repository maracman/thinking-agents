# Thinking Agents

Thinking Agents is an interactive multi-agent chat platform where you can create, configure, and interact with multiple AI agents. The platform provides a unique environment for agent-to-agent and user-to-agent conversations, with a powerful visualization system to track agent decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Conversations**: Create and manage multiple AI agents with unique personalities, goals, and behaviors.
- **Agent Settings**: Configure agent parameters including name, description, goals, and generation variables.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage in conversations with agents or let agents interact with each other.
- **Decision Graph Visualization**: View and analyze agent decision-making processes through interactive graph visualizations.
- **Developer Tools**: Debug sessions, view logs, and track agent behavior in real-time.
- **Session Management**: Save, load, duplicate, and manage chat sessions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune parameters like temperature, max tokens, and more for each agent or globally.

## Architecture

The application is built with a modern stack:

- **Frontend**: React.js with a component-based architecture
- **Backend**: Python Flask API
- **LLM Integration**: Support for multiple language model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace, and local models)
- **Graph Visualization**: Network graph visualization using PyVis
- **Session Storage**: File-based session storage using JSON

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thinking-agents.git
   cd thinking-agents
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd src
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   # Create a .env file in the root directory
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   
   # Optional API keys for various LLM providers
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key
   
   # Local model path (optional, for offline mode)
   LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/models
   LOCAL_MODEL_FILENAME=your_model_file.gguf
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

2. Build the frontend assets:
   ```
   cd src
   npm run build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Using the Application

### Creating Agents

1. Navigate to the "Agent" tab in the sidebar
2. Click "Add New Agent"
3. Configure your agent with a name, description, and goal
4. Adjust generation parameters as needed
5. Click "Save Settings"

### Starting Conversations

1. Switch to the "Chat" tab
2. Type a message and click "Send" to start a conversation
3. Use the "Play" button to let agents continue the conversation automatically
4. Use the "Pause" button to interrupt generation

### Viewing the Decision Graph

1. Go to the "Graph" tab to see agent decision-making processes
2. Select different agents from the dropdown to view their specific graphs
3. Explore the network visualization to understand agent reasoning paths

### Developer Tools

1. Navigate to the "Developer" tab
2. View session debug information and real-time logs
3. Use the refresh controls to monitor agent activities
4. Download logs for offline analysis

## Running in Offline Mode

The application can run in offline mode using local models:

1. Set `offline = True` in `app.py`
2. Ensure you have a compatible GGUF model file in your `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH`
3. The application will automatically use the local model for generations
